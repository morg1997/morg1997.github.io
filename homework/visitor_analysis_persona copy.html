				Pinterest is a great place for creative types to get together and brainstorm ideas. Pinterest has boards that you can pin creative ideas too and accomplish them yourself or to buy it from the seller.

            <h2>Contrast</h2>
                The worst site that I visited would easily be the BYU Idaho Ilearn. It was not user friendly at all, I would have to zoom in on my screen to see anything and when you clicked a button you had to wait for the page to reload, and then zoom in again. All in all very annoying. So through this experience I would have to say that BYU Idaho did not meet their target audience's needs, did not facilitate a good mobile site for target audiences, and did not organize things in an easy to read manner on the ilearn homepage. They did however know who their target audience was so that is one thing they did right.
