            <h2>Persona</h2>
                Betty is a 72 year old woman who lives in Greenville and is retired. She loves to spend her time outdoors gardening and walking. Her husband has passed so she is looking for new past times to fill that void. She is a grandmother to children that live out of state so she keeps to herself. She is frequently checking the weather to know if she can go and spend time outside doing an activity of her choice.
