            <h2>Persona</h2>
                Betty is a 72 year old woman who lives in Greenville and is retired. She loves to spend her time outdoors gardening and walking. Her husband has passed so she is looking for new past times to fill that void. She has two children and is a grandmother to children that live out of state so she keeps to herself. Her goal is to make her home a haven when they all come to visit. She is frequently checking the weather to know if she can go and spend time outside doing an activity of her choice. She loves to walk the streets looking fancy and feeling good about herself. Her quote is, "Do what you love and look good doing it."

            <h2>Peer Review</h2>
            <p>Andrea Wagner was who did my peer review this week. As we went through my site Andrea pointed out that I needed more information on my persona and audience analysis. I decided that she was right and went ahead and updated all of the information to be more specific. </p>
